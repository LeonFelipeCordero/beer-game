The Beer Game is a simulation game that was developed in the 1960s at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to teach the principles of systems thinking and the 
"Bullwhip Effect." The game simulates a supply chain, with players taking on the roles of various players
in the chain, such as retailers, wholesalers, and manufacturers. The objective of the game is to optimize
inventory and meet customer demand while minimizing costs. The game highlights the challenges of managing
a complex supply chain and the impact of decisions made at one point in the chain on the entire system.
The Beer Game is often used in business and engineering education to teach the principles of supply chain
management and systems thinking.

The Beer Game is a simulation game that simulates a supply chain, with players taking on the roles of
various actors in the chain, such as:

*Retailer:* The final link in the supply chain, the retailer is responsible for selling the product to consumers.
They place orders with the wholesaler based on their forecasted demand.

*Wholesaler*: The wholesaler receives orders from the retailer and places orders with the distributor.
They also hold inventory and are responsible for managing the inventory levels at the wholesale level.

*Factory*: The factory produces the product and receives orders from the distributor.
They are responsible for managing the production schedule and the inventory levels at the factory level.

Each player only has the visibility of their own inventory and orders but not the upstream or 
downstream players. They have to rely on the inventory and order information they receive to make
decisions on their own inventory levels and orders. The game is designed to show how decisions 
made by one player can impact the entire supply chain and how the lack of information sharing 
and communication can cause the bullwhip effect.
